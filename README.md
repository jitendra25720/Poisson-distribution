# Poisson-distribution

The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution that measures the probability of a given number of events happening in a specified time period.

### Pdf of poisson distribution

$P(X=x) = \frac{\lambda^{x} e^{-\lambda}}{x!}$

$where, \lambda > 0$

### Mean and Variance of normal distribution
- $mean = variance = \lambda$


#### The Poisson(λ) Distribution can be approximated with Normal when λ is large.
- #### If X ∼Poisson (λ)  ⇒  X ≈N ( μ=λ, σ=√λ), for λ>20, and the approximation improves as (the rate) λ increases.

### Some examples of poisson distribution
- The number of telephone calls per minute in a small business.
- The number of accidents happening per month in some area.
- The number of visitors to a web site per minute
